# AllometricScaling

This repository contains R code and a dataset used for analyzing allometric scaling relationships. The code was developed as part of a scientific project and produces plots and summaries used in a manuscript.

## Repository Contents

- `AllometricScaling.R` – Main R script for data analysis and visualization.
- `Data_HW.xlsx` – Raw data file used in the analysis.
- `LICENSE` – License information.
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage instructions.

## Requirements

To run the analysis, you need R installed along with the following R packages:

- 'openxlsx'
- 'ggplot2'
- 'ggpubr'
- 'dplyr'
- 'rstatix'
- 'effsize'
- 'sjPlot'
- 'sjmisc'
- 'sjlabelled

You can install them with:
install.packages(c("openxlsx","ggplot2",...))

## Project Description

The goal of this analysis is to investigate allometric relationships between biological variables such as body weight and heart weight and to prove that calculation ratios can be misleading.
